## Purpose 
After a few weeks of learning Javascript I wanted to test my ability to make a game. I made the AI for the computer random as TicTacToe is quite an easy game to hardcode making it almost impossible to beat the computer and i wanted to at least make a game of it. 

## Functionality and Features

It's a simple tic tac toe game, you can play against the computer on your own or against a friend!
